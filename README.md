# RealOrSynthetic

What is your plan for this weekend?

Does this question always haunt you and tend to say 'I already have plans'? 📅✅

Are these plans more inclined towards deleting 'Daily greetings' photos from your parents phone?

And cant even say no, else your engineering degree will be questioned? 🤦🏻

Here comes RealOrSynthetic exe that will differentiate real to synthetic photos. These photos can later be deleted, archived or may be printed and pasted on walls until not a single wall remains bare. 😐

As its an exe, no worry of uploading or downloading any photos and makes you feel safer as its standalone on your phone or PC. 😎

**Demo**
